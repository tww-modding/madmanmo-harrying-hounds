# Summary 
This mod makes edits to the various hound units available (Chaos Warhounds, Chaos Warhounds (Poison), Dire Wolves, The Dire Pack).

All non-poison hounds gain a harry ability which applies a snare (30%) to enemies hit. They lose a small amount of melee weapon strength in exchange.

All hounds gain a bonus to their maximum speed and acceleration, allowing them to more easily catch and murder skirmish cavalry that tries to kite them.
